# Timeline

A web application for visualizing and managing timelines.

## Getting Started

- npm

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/goncadanilo/timeline.git
cd timeline
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
npm run start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:1234`.

## Testing

To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

### What I liked about your implementation

- I liked the simplicity of implementing the zoom feature.
- I liked having created a test implementation, even if it only validated a simple case.

### What I would change if I were to do it again

- I would use a library to render each item according to its start and end dates.
- I would implement it using Typescript.
- I would create a better UX.

### How I would test this if I had more time

- I would test the rendering flow of each item on the timeline.
- I would create tests to validate the listing by simulating a request to an API.
