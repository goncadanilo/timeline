## Testing

### What I liked about your implementation

- I liked the simplicity of implementing the zoom feature.
- I liked having created a test implementation, even if it only validated a simple case.

### What I would change if I were to do it again

- I would use a library to render each item according to its start and end dates.
- I would implement it using Typescript.
- I would create a better UX, including more information of items.

### How I would test this if I had more time

- I would test the rendering flow of each item on the timeline.
- I would create tests to validate the listing by simulating a request to an API.
